Forien's UI Tweaks is a collection of HUD and UI tweaks for Foundry v13.

## Features
All features are disabled by default and can be enabled in the `Configure Settings`. All Settings are client-side.
- **Auto Expand Sidebar**: login with already expanded sidebar!
- **Default Sidebar Tab**: choose which tab should be opened when you log in. You can go straight to playlists!
- **Collapsible Hotbar**: allows you to collapse and expand hotbar at will
- **Hotbar Starts Collapsed**: makes it so Hotbar starts in collapsed state when you log in.
- **Hide Performance Stats**: hides Performance Stats from Players HUD in the bottom left.
- **Lower Pause Banner**: moves the Pause Banner from center to the lower 3rd of the screen.
- `SHIFT+CTRL+X` keybinding (editable in settings) to toggle the visibility of Interface (does not affect opened Applications like Sheets)
